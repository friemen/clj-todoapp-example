# todoapp

An architectural prototype demonstrating a full-stack single-page
application (SPA) built on top of React with a SQL-DB based backend.

Aspects shown here include:

* Usage of re-frame, Reagent

* Client-side routing

* A JSON API service layer

* A Transit based UI service layer

* Transactional DB access with a connection pool

* Use a central configuration file

* Interactive programming with Figwheel


## TODOs

* Add another page as example.

* Add authentication based on friend.

* Add API Service infrastructure.


## Usage

To start a REPL use `lein repl` in some shell.

After connecting to your REPL use `(user/system-*)` commands to
start/stop/restart the backend.

After starting the system you can access the in-process H2 DB
via http://localhost:8082 with user `sa` and empty password.

The schema is

```
create table todo (id int primary key auto_increment,
                   position int,
				   label varchar(250),
				   done bool);
```


The `user` namespace contains a `reset-db!` function which drops all
tables and re-creates them.

To interact freely with the database you can use expressions like

`(jdbc/query (:db user/system) ["select * from todo"])`.




Use `(user/start-figwheel!)` to start Figwheel (an interactive,
incremental Cljs compiler). Figwheel will also hotload your CSS into
the browser.

Use `(user/cljs-repl)` to connect your REPL to the browser.

To work interactively on your `.sass` stylesheet open a shell, cd into
your project folder and start

`sass --watch src/sass/stylesheet.sass resources/public/css`



To build a shippable uberjar type `lein uberjar`.


(After an uberjar build it's advisable to clean target and
resources/public/js folders.)
